# Scavenger Hunt Activity
As most of the group members were fairly new to the college campus we didn't have a specific plan so for the given time for the scavenger hunt we were exploring the campus and hoping to bump into the things on the list.
We First ventured to the library.

In the library we found ***"The books that contained knowledge of digital media "***\ so to take a picture with all of them we decided to search it up and pose with it!
