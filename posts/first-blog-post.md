# Scavenger Hunt Activity
As most of the group members were fairly new to the college campus we didn't have a specific plan so for the given time for the scavenger hunt we were exploring the campus and hoping to bump into the things on the list.
We First ventured to the library.

In the library we found ***"The books that contained knowledge of digital media "*** so to take a picture with all of them we decided to search it up and pose with it!

As we exited the library we noticed a vending machine selling Foreign Beverages 
* ***"A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land."***

We were a group of creative children so we decided to name our objects upon different things which we know people weren't expecting, We named a great tree with huge roots as *** " A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor"***

As we stepped out of the place we took a second a realised the gates that led us to the tree look like *** "A door for the condemned.""***

As mentioned we are a group of creattive beings so we decided we'll make our own exploding coffee therefore we took a picture in a coffee shop to re create *** " An explosive cup of coffee"***

And oddly enough as we were about to give up we saw the perfect *** " Study space fit for a Sith Lord" ***

All in all it was definitely an experience. I got a tour around the campus and met classmates of mine I wouldnâ€™t have the guts to interact with!
